# Example D3/Svelte Visualizations
These are a set of D3 visualization sketches made to supplement my [blog posts on the topic](https://jpalmer.dev/blog).

This repository was created from this [Svelte/Snowpack/TypeScript/Tailwind starter](https://github.com/GarrettCannon/snowpack-svelte-ts-tw).

# Svelte with Typescript and TailwindCSS built with Snowpack

> âœ¨ Community template for Snowpack + Svelte + Typescript + TailwindCSS

Create a new project with:

```bash
npx create-snowpack-app dir-name --template snowpack-svelte-ts-tw
```

Uses `svelte-preprocess`

## Available Scripts

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like "@snowpack/plugin-webpack" or "@snowpack/plugin-parcel" to your `snowpack.config.json` config file.
